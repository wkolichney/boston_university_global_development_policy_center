# Ad Hoc

**Code/work that does not apply to a wider project**

### 1. aiddata_join.ipynb
 - Research Assistants that I help manage complained that AidData's new [China's Global Loans and Grants](aiddata.org/data/chinas-global-loans-and-grants-dataset-1-0) was too bulky of a file to crossreference sources. This code helps my team save time by only focusing on where our data aligns with AidData's
 - Skills used: Python, Pandas, data cleaning

### 2. cla_source_check.py
- For published datasets, we provide sources as a citation for the Chinese loans we find (in this case, this is for the Chinese Loans to Africa dataset, or CLA). However, sources that use Google Drive links can deprecate. This workflow checks which Google Drive links are deprecated so replacements can be found.
- Skills used: Python, web scrapping, Pandas, Selenium, data cleaning
